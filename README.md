# Setting up

## Overview

You realize that to succeed, it is essential to create an optimal working environment. Your first challenge: to delineate the largest possible square space in the center of the laboratory. This is where you will build, experiment, and bring your ideas to life.
Fortunately, you are not entirely alone in this task. You are given a file with the current layout of the room. Your mission is to use dynamic programming to determine the largest free square. This will be the foundation for all your future projects and inventions at Epitech.

## Compilation

Compile the project using the provided Makefile:

```bash
make all
```
## Usage

```bash
./setting_up FILE
```

```bash
./setting_up layout_size pattern
./setting_up 14 "o...oo."
